## üîê Authentication & Access Control

### Registration & Login

- Users register or log in to receive a **JWT token**
- Token is stored in **localStorage**

### Token Usage

- Sent on all authenticated requests:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
  ```

### Protected Routes (Frontend)

- Add/Edit/Delete books require authentication
- Only the **creator** of a book can edit or delete it
- Redux checks `userState.isLoggedIn` for route access
- On logout, the token is removed and the state reset

### Public Access

- Anyone (even without an account) can:
  - View all books
  - View individual book details
